Robots
What does it do?
Robots are a machine designed to execute tasks in an automated fashion to reduce the need of human intervention. The industrial sector uses robotics for the majority of manufacturing tasks such as lifting and welding parts together using what the robot has been gifted. Many people think of robots as machines designed to appearance human with the functionality of completing daily tasks however that is just a single type of robot with a human model and the name for this type of robot is an android. The android robots aren’t actually capable of being thinking, learning and apply learned knowledge without an artificial intelligence program being loaded however a full AI program is unlikely to loaded into a machine with real world capabilities for a long time until AI is more understood and we aren’t even at such as stage yet so machine learning would be the second option.
Robots are used in the military all the time as it saves human lives from people who are potential threats. Military robots can either be autonomous or remote controlled mobile robots however either method of controls will still do it’s job and can be more easily replaced than someone who is in control of the robot. These military robots have many capabilities and uses such as detecting and disabling bombs, flying over the enemy bases and dropping bombs or detecting locations of enemy forces, transportation machines with weapons attached and automated firing and so much more.
Boston Dynamics is a company widely known for the engineering of multipurpose robots and has even received funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for many years and have not disclose the reason why however the reasoning may already be obvious. Speaking about Boston Dynamics while we are on the subject, they have recently released their robot dog also known as SPOT however this robot model does not look too much like a dog and does not act like one either besides the part of doing it what you tell it to do. SPOT is a robot designed and sold to big companies for many different uses and has the capabilities of functioning fully autonomous which is a very big leap to the future. This robot has the ability to work in construction, mining, healthcare, public safety, oil and gas, research and even just as entertainment with the optionality feature of sensors, an artificial learning device, and other types of addon awareness. 

What is the likely impact?
Robots will most likely take jobs away from working roles that seem unattractive however that will mean the rise of more jobs so being worried about work should not be an issue. Automation is a thing of the future and is going to happen either way however people should be more prepared instead of being worried. Studying engineering and learning different skills should keep a person relevant and hireable instead of redundant. People however could be lazy and unmotivated without the need to do simple and boring tasks such as cleaning the dishes because we have dish washers and maybe a robot that will even rinse the dishes before hand the clean the dish washer after or wash the clothes and hang them to dry. 
With the advancement of robotics, many different industry sectors will evolve to complete tasks way better on every dimension than a human being. This being said there is still a long way from this for example, can we really trust a machine to operate on a human being and complete the task more effective and safely. The difficulty of these situations are because we haven’t had much research and advancements into these scenarios because like I stated above, who would really participate in being the subject for any trial people are running.
How will this affect you?
Having more robots advancing society is very appealing to myself as it could potentially make my life a lot more productive and easier. It saves a lot of time knowing I have a robot to clean my floors instead of spending thirty minutes doing it myself when I could easily find a better thing to do such as spending time with my family, going to the gym, studying, working and the list goes on.
