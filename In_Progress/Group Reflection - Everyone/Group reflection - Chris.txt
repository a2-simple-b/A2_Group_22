Group Reflection - Chris

At first, I was a bit lost about how to join a team for the following assignments; I was fortunate enough to be assigned to this group. We had an efficient set up from the beginning by Ian, and hence the subsequent meetings and deadlines were made by our team members. 

Although there was a little hiccup where one of the group members suffered a loss of her close family member, we managed to handle the situation with grace and glad that she is still with us throughout this challenging time. While I am relatively new to the IT world and all of the team members are more experienced than I am, I am glad that I am learning more of the world of IT as I went along with the assignment; and the fact that my teammates are happy to assist me with GitHub and explain the technical side of the task made me feel supported. 

I am surprised to see that all of the team members were actively contribute to the discussions and staying on top of their game throughout the assignment. I think this assignment demonstrated how technology facilitates the modern way of living when all of us live in different cities, and across different time zones, we can still be there for each other and focus on the common goal.
