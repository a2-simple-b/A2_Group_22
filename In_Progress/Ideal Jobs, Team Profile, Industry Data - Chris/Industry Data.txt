For our group, the three ideal jobs that most of our group mates resonate with are systems engineer, systems administrator and software developer. According to the data supplied by Burning Glass Technologies, the three ideal jobs were in the 98.5, 96.5 and 91 percentiles of the IT jobs in March 2018. 

According to the required IT-specific skills for our ideal jobs, Java, Microsoft Windows, Linux and C++ rank the highest in terms of demand from the employers. It can be interpreted that the ability to write different computing languages and experience in using different operating systems will make you a highly competitive professional. Other required skill sets that are not quite in demand are the experience in VPN. Hyper-V and VMware ESXi. The highest-ranking IT-specific skills that are not in our necessary expertise are SAP, Oracle and Git.  For a visual interpretation of the competitiveness of required skill sets, please refer to the diagram below for the ranking and respective percentiles. 

Apart from the required IT-specific skillsets for the ideal jobs, some general soft skills are equally important. For our ideal jobs, having the ability to solve clientsâ€™ issues and last-minute obstacles through investigation and critical-analyse is crucial. Those three sills ranked at the 96, 92.5 and 78 percentiles and can be deemed as high demand from employers for the foreseeable future. While communication, writing and organisational skills are the highest demands of general skills that a potential employer wants, those are not the particular skills that are required. 

After investigating the available data, our opinion in what career paths we wish to pursue had not changed. The team members who will seek to be a developer or administration position have knowledge in coding and exposure with different operating systems. Once they went through the degree with RMIT, the necessary technical skill sets in high demand will be acquired. From working through the assignment together, it is proven that the teammates have critical soft skills such as problem-solving and analytical skills. As the expertise is perfectly aligned with the future demands for IT-related positions, we believe that the ideal jobs provide a stable career path for future growth.
