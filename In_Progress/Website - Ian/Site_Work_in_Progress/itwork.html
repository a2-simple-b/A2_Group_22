<p>Jess: Hello Rene</p>

<p>Rene: Hello</p>

<p>Jess: First of all, thanks for taking some time out of your busy schedule to have a chat with me, I really appreciate it. I hope you don’t mind that I am recording this and if you want a copy, I can pass it along if you need it for anything.</p>

<p>Rene: Nope, That’s OK</p>

<p>Jess: All right, well I’ll get straight to it. So you’re a Senior Systems Engineer at Subnet</p>

<p>Rene: Correct</p>

<p>Jess: What exactly does your day to day work involve?
<p>Rene: It kind of changes on a day to day role, a day to day basis sorry. .. like we do here… helping with design solutions, costing solutions and yeah, just general support and implementing solutions as well. 
<p>Jess: Right.
<p>Jess: And the type of clients that you typically work with for solutions, what fields are they in?
<p>Rene: Yeah, a bit of everything. We touch a few not for profits. Trying to think of who else. 
<p>Jess: You guys do Education, like the schools as well don’t you?
Rene: Yeah, that’s kind of dropping off though. Pulling it all into themself, to try and push any third party providers away but personally myself, I’m kind of accounting and not for profit… mostly around citrix solutions.
-<p>Jess: What is Citrix?
<p>Rene: Okay… so that is
<p>Rene: It’s come in quite handy over the last few months. 
<p>Jess: Right, so due to COVID you have a lot of interest in Citrix at the moment. 
<p>Rene: Well I wouldn’t put it like that because of the time setting it up for people, but for the people that already got it, have really managed to take advantage of it.
<p>Jess: Ok gotcha. 
<p>Jess: What other kinds of work are you required to do at Subnet that isn’t really typical of a Systems Engineer job?
<p>Rene: Look after the front desk.
<p>Jess: Yep, oh so help desk stuff
<p>Rene: well even Reception. 
<p>Jess: Oh right
<p>Rene: I’ll sit in reception if reception’s not there. 
<p>Jess: So if clients come in you might be sitting at the front greeting them
<p>Rene: I’ll go and look after them if reception is not there, apart from that though that’s probably the only case. 
<p>Jess: Right, so you obviously have a lot of client relationship experience
<p>Rene: Correct!
<p>Jess: To get to where you were, did you study many years, did you study a degree?
<p>Rene: Yes, I’ve got a Bachelor of Computer Science
<p>Jess: Computer Science, ok, was that your goal, to become a Systems Engineer?
<p>Rene: Probably not at the time. So Computer Science degree is more focussed on programming and that kinda stuff. I was kinda a bit burnt out when I finished Uni I kinda just fell into this path to be a Systems Engineer
<p>Jess: What aspects of your work do you find you spend the most time on every day
<p>Rene: Um it can change from day to day. A lot of it is UAT and testing
<p>Jess: You find you do that on a daily basis, something routinely.
<p>Jess: You test for months on end, or do you get people to test, how does that work?
<p>Rene: We get users to test, cause we don’t know how the applications work ourself in terms of the finance package or…
<p>Jess: Where do you find users to do that?
<p>Rene: Clients get volunteers - we get volunteers via our contacts
<p>Jess: Do you find any aspects of your work quite challenging?
<p>Rene: Probably just keeping up with workload. 
<p>Jess: Keeping up with workload, so it’s just constant busy time. 
<p>Rene: Yeah, um cause I’ve got a pretty good relationship with so many clients
<p>Jess: It’s hard to give them all… the same
<p>Rene: Yeah, same level of service every time.
<p>Jess: Do you like the challenge that comes with your job?

<p>Rene: Yeah yeah for sure. One day we’ll retire and be a IT Manager but we can’t do it now because we’d get too bored.
<p>Jess: Are there any other areas of the IT Industry that you’d like to work on or possibly move into
<p>Rene:Yeah down the road, when you retire - something less stressful.
<p>Jess: Less stressful, so an IT Manager do you think will be less stressful? 

<p>Jess: Do you think you’ll be a Systems Engineer for a while yet? Can you see yourself changing paths?
<p>Rene: Probably not in the next couple of years but maybe after that yes
<p>Jess: Do you get to work with new technology? I wanted to ask you when you speak with clients, do you sometimes always have to sell what you work on. For example they might need to upgrade to office 365 but they might have a CFO that doesn’t agree with that, do you find that challenging? Having to know that you’ve already upgraded and you’re working with clients that are advanced and you go back to other client who is still in the dinosaur ages?<p>

<p>Rene: I wouldn’t say dinosaur age but yes, can be challenging yes.
