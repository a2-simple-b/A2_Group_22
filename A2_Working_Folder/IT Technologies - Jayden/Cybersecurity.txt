What does it do?
Due to technology expanding rapidly, cybersecurity is a growing field that will continue to grow until such time. New devices are being created and will be connected to the internet using 5G. Most devices will be vulnerable to attacks and that’s why machine learning is also growing in the cybersecurity field in hopes to minimise vulnerabilities in technology.
The most common attack vectors in cybersecurity are already regulated with machine learning, specifically when it comes to financial assets. Hackers will continue to target health and financial organisations due to their high value and worth. These organisation sectors will always work to be the most secure and will implement strategies to prevent attacks and protect its customers.
The rise of ransomware has costed organisations billions of dollars every single year and machine learning may not be able to prevent every attack vector. Quantum computers are designed to calculate complex algorithms that non-traditional computers can’t. Quantum computers will be able to break cryptography and weaken ones that can’t be broken. This may be possible within the next three years but only to people and organisations who can afford a quantum computer due to how expensive the system costs and to maintain it.
Security experts continuously look for vulnerabilities in both software and hardware to report the flaw to organisations. Usually, these organisations offer a bug bounty program that offers money or reputation in return for reporting the vulnerability. Because of this, the cybersecurity industry will become increasingly more competitive, and more people are coming to the field due to the high demand.
In the next few years, cybersecurity will have evolved becoming entirely different from the current circumstances due to technology evolving but the principals and methodology will have stayed the same. Security will have changed massively as companies increasingly make employees more aware of social engineering attack vectors which is one of the most effective ways at attacking targets as people can be more vulnerable than the machines they use and once an attacker gains access it can be difficult to claim back the device and costing millions of dollars.

Cyber security will continue to be a rising industry due to the necessary protection of peoples and companies private information such as account numbers, passwords, security questions, bank reports, etc. Criminals like to steal information to use for fraud and or other personal gains as they can be very valuable. Say you have an account on a website and you pay for a yearly subscription worth over $100, a cyber criminal will find it very beneficial to steal those accounts from people and sell them for lower prices as the criminal isn’t paying for it and can keep all the profits from your money. This is why many cyber security companies have created many different protection methods to keeping your data secure with a fee.
Virtual private networks (VPNs) are a great way to encrypt all your internet traffic when connect to hotspots more particularly at hotels, airports and cafes. Hackers are able to redirect all your traffic through their computer with the ease of just running a public program on their side. VPN companies make incredible profits for their security services they provide to customers and are able to advertise their other services which is very laser targeted because individuals and organisations who are already concerned about cyber security are very likely to take advantage of other offers that will increase their protection. The only fault with virtual private networks are the fact you have to trust the organisation that they don’t keep logs if you really want to keep anonymity however some companies will tell you they do which shows their honesty. 
Passwords are the key to private information such as bank logins, VPNs, PayPal, emails, YouTube and every other website with an account feature. A service that is very popular for customers who use a virtual private network is an account manager that will store all your logins including emails, usernames and passwords. These accounts are usually stored in the cloud so a user can just log in on any of their devices to use any of their stored credentials and this allows the customer to have complicated passwords that are not so easy to remember. The benefit of having a password manager is only having to remember one login which acts as the master key to other keys and this data is usually always encrypted to prevent cyber criminals from viewing your passwords even if the website was hacked.
Encryption is used to keep data secure when people may have access to the data leaving the intruder unable to read it.  Websites usually encrypted your login details and their logs to prevent hackers from viewing information even if they have gained access to the website. All encryption uses complicated mathematical algorithms to make data harder to decrypt unless the attacker had access to the key or a quantum computer. As mentioned before, quantum computers will be a downfall for encryption making it not so much a viable solution however there may be hope with quantum safe encryption replacing standard encryption.
Doxing isn’t so much hacking and is more private investigation upon mostly individuals when people are searching for information such as date of birth, address, phone number, usernames, locations and so much more from the comfort behind a computer so no work has to be completed following people around. These little pieces of information can lead to fraud, password cracking and other attack vectors, one of them being a sim swap attack.
There are lots of different attack vectors that could be used to exploit many situations and gaining access to user data. Sim swap attacks have started being utilised recently and involves social engineering to complete the attack. Firstly, social engineering is the process of manipulating people into doing tasks with the attack imposing as someone they are not. Lets say someone has doxed (the completed process of doxing) an individual and they find out the person has a lot of money stored in bitcoin. The attacker already knows the internet service provider the victim users due to knowing the phone number and from there are able to retrieve that information online. The attacker calls the company from the victims phone number using a process known as spoofing and imposes as the victim and says they need to do a sim transfer to one they have in their possession. This will allow the attacker to bypass to security function known as 2 factor authentication which relies on the user logging in with their normal details but have a code sent to their phone however there is other ways for the user to protect themselves.
All in all cyber security with be advancing in the future as new attacks rise so will the protections otherwise the internet would not be very safe. Outdated attacks get repurposed in some situations and others they are obsolete never to be used again however the knowledge of how they work can come in handy to prevent the same mistake. Cyber security is a serious area of technology that needs to be always advancing and knowing what the latest trends attackers are using.
