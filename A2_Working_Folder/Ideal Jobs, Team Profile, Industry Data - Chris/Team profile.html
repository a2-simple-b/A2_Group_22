    2. Combination of our personalities and how this may be helpful for group
    functionality.
</p>
<p>
    A sound formation of a team is to combine people with opposite personality
    traits. People with opposing personalities can balance the organisation and
    provide a well-rounded environment, hence improve healthy discussions and
    deliver more significant outputs.
</p>
<p>
    Each member has a different style of how to learn a piece of new
    information or to work in a new project. There is no doubt that the best
    form of a group is to have the same learning style. Nevertheless, it is
    crucial to understand what method works best for your fellow members and to
    find the best middle ground to learn and express your opinions.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, we have a group of extrovert members of the team, which means that
    we can efficiently bounce off ideas to streamline the preparation process
    of group assignment. It is essential to keep in mind that while we are all
    passionate about our beliefs and way of operations, mutual respect and
    ability to adopt others’ opinions are critical to maintaining harmony in
    the group.
</p>
<p>
    Most of the team members express that visual learning is preferable, so
    with future meetings and team works; it will be best to visualise our
    progress and ideas to convey the message across to other team members.
</p>
<p>
    With regarding other personality traits, we are a group of people who are
    curious with the unknowns and enjoy clear organisation. Self-discipline is
    a shared personality in the group, and it is reassuring to know that the
    group can progress through the course with clear goals and maintain a high
    level of collaboration.
