                       <p>A sound formation of a team is to combine people with opposite personality traits. People with opposing personalities can balance the organisation and provide a well-rounded environment, hence improve healthy discussions and deliver more significant outputs.</p>
      

                        <p>The team name SiMPLe B is an anagram of the names of the founding members - Jess Bayly, Chris Lai, Ian McElwaine, Charles Patterson, and Jayden Stewart.</p>


 
<p>Each member has a different style of how to learn a piece of new information or to work in a new project. There is no doubt that the best form of a group is to have the same learning style. Nevertheless, it is crucial to understand what method works best for your fellow members and to find the best middle ground to learn and express your opinions.</p>
 
<p>Overall, we have a group of extrovert members of the team, which means that we can efficiently bounce off ideas to streamline the preparation process of group assignment. It is essential to keep in mind that while we are all passionate about our beliefs and way of operations, mutual respect and ability to adopt others’ opinions are critical to maintaining harmony in the group.</p>
 
<p>Most of the team members express that visual learning is preferable, so with future meetings and team works; it will be best to visualise our progress and ideas to convey the message across to other team members.</p>
 
<p>With regarding other personality traits, we are a group of people who are curious with the unknowns and enjoy clear organisation. Self-discipline is a shared personality in the group, and it is reassuring to know that the group can progress through the course with clear goals and maintain a high level of collaboration.</p>

							<h3>A message from the Team</h3>
							<p>“Our team has people with a diverse range of skills and personality traits. We have found that having diversity in our team has balanced our organisation and provided a well-rounded working environment. We have enjoyed healthy discussions and clarity of purpose.
Each team member is a different part of the puzzle. By combining our skills together, we have been able to complete this project while physically located in different parts of Australia. With this idea in find, we combined the initials of our surnames (plus a couple of vowels) to form our team name” – SiMPLe B</p>
