When I was accepted into this group, it was clear from the beginning that our team would be effective communicators. Ian had created a very detailed breakdown of Assessment 2 which made me feel well prepared. In the first week, we set up an introduction video meeting to talk through all the requirements, expectations and skill sets as well as provide our personal git hub pages. Meeting minutes were shared to the group within an hour of the video chat.

Personally, I was assigned with the task of interviewing an IT professional and the PDF report. However, I experienced a family tragedy and was prepared to pull out in case I couldn’t participate as much as I should. My team encouraged me to stay with it, took some of the load off me and that made me feel extremely supported and glad I didn’t throw in the towel. I haven’t been able to make each video meeting, but I have been given meeting minutes and updates from Ian who has keep me across everything during this time. 

I’ve learnt that communication is vital in working with a group. Even if we all live in different time zones or life gets in the way, being able to communicate means we can come up with best solutions for a successful outcome for each member.
