								<h6>So what went well?</h6>
																<p>Organisation from the start seemed to play a crucial role in the completion of this assessment. Ian had created an intranet containing meeting information, roles, tasks, and useful links. This made the assessment more organised from the beginning allowing team members to quickly locate information. </p>
																<p>Communication was also another big factor amongst the group, being able to communicate issues due to current personal situation's has given us the ability to check on each other and see who might be struggling with the work loads designated. If someone was unable to complete a task or needed help, team members were more than happy to cooperate to help reach the end goal.</p>
																<br>
<h6>What could be improved for next time?</h6>
<p>Next time, I believe that the initial setup and use of GitHub could be improved. At the beginning some members were having issues committing files due to permissions. I later figured out that it was related to the use of ‘GitHub Organisations’. Going into this assessment, I wanted to have had setup permission levels in GitHub so team members could only access specific folders related to their work.<br>
I also think that meeting deadlines could have been improved, as having tasks finished after deadlines has the impacted time needed for polishing and ensuring content is correct.</p>

<h6>What was surprising?</h6>
As the team was formed, I immediately started recognising personality traits from the A1 Assessment task. This was very surprising as I originally thought it would have taken a while for the group to adapt to each other before their personalities came through.</p>
<p>Jayden's complex creativity shined through when discussing the project idea, Chris’s ability as a visual learner was recognised through diagrams, Jess had a willingness to learn and was observant towards issues she faced, and Ian being an Assertive protagonist was evident during meetings (Hosting) as he coordinated tasks to be completed and job roles effectively.</p>
<p>As we progressed, Ian reinforced my perception of how important organisation is within a group. His intranet had a huge impact on the group’s workflow. I was surprised by this as I have never really seen organisation as an essential factor, now I can see the full benefits if used effectively.</p>

<h6>What have I learned about groups?</h6>
<p>I have learnt that the delegation of roles is important from the beginning. Assessing each other’s strengths and abilities when assigning tasks.
	<br>
Organisation and communication within the group are essential and without it the group would cease to exist. 
	<br>
I also learned that this assessment task would have been extremely difficult to do alone. Having team members collaborate with set tasks is the only way this assessment could have been completed.</p>

<h6>Tools</h6>
<p>The GitHub log of activity accurately reflects the inefficient workflow at the beginning. Ian was doing web development and had got into the habit of committing directly to the master. If errors were made then this would result in the rollback of the master branch causing other brands in the organisation to also pull these rollbacks. Despite this, I can see how useful it was for Ian to conduct his workflow on the master branch as GitHub Pages interacts differently with extensions compared to local versions of websites.</p><p>Ian and myself also developed the habit of constantly pushing updates to the master repository, A better way of doing this would be updating in versions once tasks are fully completed. We later discussed this and tried our best to remove these mistakes.

																<p>At first, I was a bit lost about how to join a team for the following assignments; I was fortunate enough to be assigned to this group. We had an efficient set up from the beginning by Ian, and hence the subsequent meetings and deadlines were made by our team members.</p>
																<p>Although there was a little hiccup where one of the group members suffered a loss of her close family member, we managed to handle the situation with grace and glad that she is still with us throughout this challenging time. While I am relatively new to the IT world and all of the team members are more experienced than I am, I am glad that I am learning more of the world of IT as I went along with the assignment; and the fact that my teammates are happy to assist me with GitHub and explain the technical side of the task made me feel supported.</p>
																<p>I am surprised to see that all of the team members were actively contribute to the discussions and staying on top of their game throughout the assignment. I think this assignment demonstrated how technology facilitates the modern way of living when all of us live in different cities, and across different time zones, we can still be there for each other and focus on the common goal.</p>

																<p>The group formed very quickly as it was hard to find an open team at the time however the problem was quickly resolved of as others had the same problem and came to join the group. Attitudes could have been different especially on the trust side. It was surprising the different backgrounds people have been associated with information technology and this course. There are many different types of people with different thoughts than ourselves so collaborating with others is easier when it isn’t random and more selective. Some used GitHub to log more than others which can be either good or bad depending on what the reasoning was.</p>

																<p>When I was accepted into this group, it was clear from the beginning that our team would be effective communicators. Ian had created a very detailed breakdown of Assessment 2 which made me feel well prepared. In the first week, we set up an introduction video meeting to talk through all the requirements, expectations and skill sets as well as provide our personal git hub pages. Meeting minutes were shared to the group within an hour of the video chat.

<p>Personally, I was assigned with the task of interviewing an IT professional and the PDF report. However, I experienced a family tragedy and was prepared to pull out in case I couldn’t participate as much as I should. My team encouraged me to stay with it, took some of the load off me and that made me feel extremely supported and glad I didn’t throw in the towel. I haven’t been able to make each video meeting, but I have been given meeting minutes and updates from Ian via Slack call who has kept me across everything during this time.</p>

<p>I’ve learnt that communication is vital in working with a group. Even if we all live in different time zones or life gets in the way, being able to communicate means we can come up with best solutions for a successful outcome for each member.
